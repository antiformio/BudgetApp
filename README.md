# BudgetApp

This is a Budget App built with python. This app takes the input of raw data from a gspread sheet and builds a PDF with the monthly expenses analysis.
The analysis generates a PDF that can be saved and sent to a specific set o pre-defined emails.

The analysis is made recuring to pandas, matplotlib and numpy. 

The interface is built with tkinter.
