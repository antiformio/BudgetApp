# BudgetApp

This is a Budget App built with python. This app takes the input of raw data from a gspread sheet and builds a PDF with the monthly expenses analysis.
The analysis generates a PDF that can be saved and sent to a specific set o pre-defined emails.

The analysis is made recuring to pandas, matplotlib and numpy. 

The interface is built with tkinter.

Future versions will be able to serialize the dataframes so the expenses can be compared to previous months.
